    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>OpenStack, as a nested distributed system(where some of the subsystems are distributed systems), to troubleshoot on it could be quite tricky, not to mention its interdependence with other distributed systems in real word.</p>
<p>We all share the feelings on how hard it is to solve a hidden issue in a distributed system as each call during a chain of invocation is unpredictable, the methods/ tools for sniffing/ tracking each part are either too hard, incapable, outside of control, or too expensive.</p>
<p>The trigger made me composing this blog is the article: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/challenges-with-distributed-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Challenges with distributed systems</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobgabrielson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Gabrielson</a>, where Jacob expounded how and why designing/ managing a request/response distributed system is challenging. I recommend to read it 😊. </p>
<p>The story in this blog is a troubleshoot case I solved in a customer staging network years ago, where OpenStack clusters were integrated with some other different (virtual) Network Function clusters.</p>
<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>There were many OpenStack Clusters onsite, with different VNFs running on top of them. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two months before I arrived the customer site, the alarm <code>[NTP Upstream Server Failure]</code> was raised in one of the OpenStack Cluster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Every party involved on this issue had looked into it jointly and each of them claimed they are all good: no clue to move on, and after the whole site’s yearly power down and up activity, the issue was gone. </p>
</li>
<li><p>One week ago, after a control plane nodes reboot, this alarm was raised again on another OpenStack Cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewing everything to have the pattern of the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There were two types of servers acted as upstream NTP for Openstack Clusters. Let’s say NTP-A and NTP-B, they were actually not dedicated NTP servers but a more heavy network function(NF):</p>

-->
<img src="/distributed-bugs-are-often-latent-a-troubleshoot-story/NTP_Openstack_0.png" class="">

<ul>
<li>NTP-A was the one associated with the issue OpenStack Clusters, which was a VNF running in Linux.</li>
<li>NTP-B was a native NF in Solaris, to be repalced by NTP-A in future. #Customer has reasons to worry the issue more 😜.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The OpenStack side claimed they were good because they captured the NTP client packet sent to NTP-A and no response recieved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The other side checked everything around NTP configuration, network etc. nothing abnormal was sorted out. Thus they had to blame the OpenStack side as there were other systems utilizing their NTP-A as upstream NTP, while no issues had encounterred.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then both side suspected the packet was dropped somehow between NTP-A and OpenStack Cluster: the networking/ switches.</p>
<ul>
<li>The switch team observed nothing pointing to packet drop from the traffic .</li>
<li>Even though there was chance they didn’t capture the drop on right time, why only OpenStack’s NTP request not responded?</li>
<li>Was this issue happening in small frequency?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Troubleshoot-Story"><a href="#Troubleshoot-Story" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshoot Story"></a>Troubleshoot Story</h2><p>Luckily yet unfortunately, the alarm was kept being raised from OpenStack Cluster a, let’s call it OS-a, I started to look into this issue from it.</p>
<p>First, allow me to explain how this OS-a call upstream NTP.</p>
<p>From below figure, I used blue arrow to show a NTP client to server call, we could see all nodes include control-plane node(cpn), and other nodes configured their upstream NTP server as the control-plane hypervisor. Thus the alarm actually means something is wrong around the circle in the figure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>note, in this OpenStack Cluster, the control-plane nodes were VMs hosted by cpn hypervisor node</p>
</blockquote>

-->
<img src="/distributed-bugs-are-often-latent-a-troubleshoot-story/NTP_Openstack_OS_to_external_NTP.png" class="">

<p>And let’s check NTP stats from the cpn hypervisor node, from below we could tell the [NTP server side packet not being recieved] frequency was hard to say small: in last <code>256 * 8</code> seconds of the moment, 3 of 8 NTP polling hadn’t get responded packet. By checking the alarm triggerring code, it’s found only after more than 1800 seconds a upstream NTP server not responding, a alarm will be raised, which is a slightly high threhold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>note, please refer to <strong><a href="#Appendix">Appendix: <code>ntpd -pn</code> explained</a></strong> on how we get this information from below printout.</p>
</blockquote>

-->
<img src="/distributed-bugs-are-often-latent-a-troubleshoot-story/ntpq_cpn_hypervisor.png" class="">
<p>It’s a good sign to know this issue was actually easier to have the minimum reproduction: just query it directly from cpn hypervisor node, and, it’s in high frequency(easy to repoduce). </p>
<p>Then we have below questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What made our NTP call different from other systems(to possibly cause this issue)?</li>
<li>Why it’s not happening not for always? And related to reboot?</li>
</ul>
<p>With above questions, I looked into the above blue circle between cpn hypervisor node and external NTP. The external NTP server is only reachable from OaM Network, under the hood cpn hypervisor node actually reached external NTP-A via a vRouter running inside cpn. That is, the last path of above blue circle is actually this orange circle below, aka, not from cpn hypervisor node itself.</p>
<!--
<img src="distributed-bugs-are-often-latent-a-troubleshoot-story/vrouter_to_external_NTP.png" alt="vrouter_to_external_NTP" style="zoom:67%;" />
--> 
<img src="/distributed-bugs-are-often-latent-a-troubleshoot-story/vrouter_to_external_NTP.png" class="">

<p>With above knowledge, packet from its cpn vRouter was captured:</p>
<p>By checking the packet with <code>no.482</code>, whose client NTP call was not responded(others around it got responded), something intresting was found:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Source Port of this packet is not the well-known <code>123</code> port, instead, it’s <code>108</code>.</li>
<li>For those got resonped in this cluster, they are in source port <code>123</code>.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/distributed-bugs-are-often-latent-a-troubleshoot-story/tcpdump_vrouter_ntp.png" class="">

<p>This was something close to the turth, still more questions to answer😀:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was other cluster(without issues) in samliar situation? <code>src.port==108</code>?<ul>
<li>Yes and No, I checked on other Openstack Cluster, all other clusters had one <code>non-123 port</code> being used when reaching NTP servers, while only this cluster encounted issues.<ul>
<li>Should client source port be the well-known 123? <ul>
<li>No, it’s not mandatory in <code>non-symmetric modes</code> referring to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rfc5905</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seemed like a dead end!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why was source port being modified?<ul>
<li>The vRouter used masquerade NAT, if at the same time(close enough) more than one NTP requests from different cpn hypervisor nodes were sent to same remote NTP, inside vRouter it would trigger source ports modification.<ul>
<li>The modification was randomly chosen and fixed in first time in memory.<ul>
<li>This also explained why it’s related to system reboot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we know information on how and why source port was modified in the alarm-raising cluster, but still cannot figure out why only that cluster encountered issue. At that time I really didn’t have more ideas, but the difference seemed to be related to in the random source port it chosed. I guessed something could be wrong on handling non-123 src.port NTP requests, then I googled this with keyword like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=ntp+non-123+port+drop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ntp non-123 port drop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, I got some clue here: <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1171630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1171630</a>.</p>
<p>From the bug page we could tell, in certain verison of ntpd (like 4.2.7) , there was a bug to drop ntp request with source port number below 123, and it was fixexd in 4.2.8:</p>

<h2 id="TLDR"><a href="#TLDR" class="headerlink" title="TLDR;"></a>TLDR;</h2><p>Then I asked the NTP-A administorator to confirm the ntpd version, it was 4.2.7😜. </p>
<p>The solution will be: upgrade nptd from NTP-A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>also, we come to know that the NTP-B was too old to have this NTP bug in its ntpd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I am not a story-teller but, I really consider this troubleshoot case intresting, and it’s true as quoted from Jacob: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distributed bugs are often latent.</p>

<p>We could focus on three columns of <code>when</code>, <code>poll</code>, <code>reach</code> as explained in above manual and below square. It told us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stats will poll remote NTP servers in interval: 256 s</li>
<li>For remote server<code>172.21.96.29</code> marked in purple arrow:<ul>
<li>It received last packet since 204 seconds.</li>
<li>And for last 8 times stats, 3 times of the service side respond were not recieved</li>
</ul>

<li>For remote server<code>172.21.81.189</code> marked in purple arrow:<ul>

<p>在云计算研发部门搬砖半年，一直做一些很小的feature开发，连着几个月早出晚归加上牺牲周末时间的赶进度让我内心很不平静。我需要做点什么，因为本质上我热爱的是 <code>build things</code>，做一个<code>proper side project</code> 的主意在脑子里转了好久了，我决定先做一个简单的东西出来。</p>
<p>这个东西就是一个 <code>resource board</code> 。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>学到什么</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>resourece borard</code> 是我起的名字，其实就是一份在线的表格、面板，本质上用 <code>O365</code> / <code>onedrive for business</code> 完全可以实现类似的功效。不过我还是想造这样一个轮子，涉及一下产品开发的全生命周期的从无到有的创造、学习、实践：</p>
<ul>
<li>planning, prototyping</li>
<li>architecture</li>
<li>front end</li>
<li>back end</li>
<li>CI/ CD</li>
<li>maintenance</li>
<li>refactoring<ul>
<li>for test</li>
<li>for scale</li>

<li>tuning</li>
</ul>

<p>User story of resource board</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>resource board</code> 主要解决异地团队协作中对共享资源使用的问题，它是一个电子化的资源使用白板。</p>
<p>试想一下没有资源占用白板的时候，团队里的人共享10个虚拟化数据中心，我们简称 <code>DC</code> ，对于它的使用分几个场景：</p>
<ul>
<li>CI <ul>
<li>被CI占用，没有再触发CI调用它的人不可以干预</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>testing<ul>
<li>被非独占式的人使用中，特定的人可以并行使用它，（理想情况下）不会干扰到彼此</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>occupied<ul>
<li>被人独占使用，不可与别人共享</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>free<ul>
<li>任何人可以使用它，或者挪作其他用途</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>这种情况下，使用它的A同学需要站起来告诉所有人，或者群发邮件，说我要用 <code>DC123</code> 独占调试一个代码，有人在用么？ 10分钟后，在注意到没人回复的情况下，ta就在 <code>DC123</code>上开始<del>做坏事</del> 调试ta的代码了。然而刚从厕所回来的B同学，却发现ta的环境被破坏了，半天白忙活了😢。</p>
<p>如果这个资源共享的工作方式之中引入了记录资源占用情况的白板，A同学只需要看一下白板上空闲的DC，发现<code>DC125</code> 可以使用，他可以做到：</p>
<ul>
<li>无需等待确认广播信息的回复立刻使用 <code>DC125</code></li>
<li>不会破坏任何被占用的资源环境比如 <code>DC123</code> </li>
</ul>
<p>看起来比较自然。</p>

<h2 id="简单原型"><a href="#简单原型" class="headerlink" title="简单原型"></a>简单原型</h2><p>我用Balsamiq Mockups 简单做了一个原型：</p>
<ul>
<li>用卡片表示每一个资源的信息</li>
<li>不同的section表示资源被使用的状态，或者分类</li>
<li>提供面向资源的历史查看页面</li>
</ul>
<p>我没有花更多时间去画更详细的原型图，只是在画这个初始的版本的过程中引导我思考我初始的数据schema，前后端最开始要做的事情，一旦雏形确定下来，我就直接进入前后端的开发，在开发中直接实现业务逻辑的进化。</p>

<h2 id="前端、设计"><a href="#前端、设计" class="headerlink" title="前端、设计"></a>前端、设计</h2><h3 id="基础架子"><a href="#基础架子" class="headerlink" title="基础架子"></a>基础架子</h3><p>因为我不是一个JS guy、UI design guy，我选择了适合轻量级快速实现的方案: vue.js + material design。</p>
<p><del>一年</del>两年之前，我用：</p>
<ul>
<li>一本书(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-4th/dp/0133966151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Non-Designer’s Design Book (4th Edition)</a> )</li>
<li>一个框架(<a href="https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materialCSS</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>做了一个遗留系统改造的Prove of Concept (<a href="https://github.com/littlewey/yet-another-GSC-C-lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inno-search</a>)，那个过程我尝到了设计甜头，对于我这个没有任何设计经验的人，只是使用几个基本的设计 principle 就做出来明显没有设计缺陷的东西真的很有成就感，我甚至做了一个推广视频来在公司内部电视上播放 ( promo video here: <a href="https://vimeo.com/219328622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://vimeo.com/219328622</a> )。</p>
<p>扯远了，这一次我还想使用 material design 的设计元素，来垒砌这个简单的board。</p>
<p>因为想尝试一下响应式的前端的开发，我选择 <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue.js</a> 和 <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vuetify.js</a> 。</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> 如果我继续丰富工具的feature，我会考虑用 <a href="http://vma.isocked.com/#/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vue matierial admin</a> 堆砌更丰富的功能出来。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>另外，<a href="https://element.eleme.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">element-ui</a> 也是一个选择，也许我之后会用它做点什么 😝。</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="实时性需求"><a href="#实时性需求" class="headerlink" title="实时性需求"></a>实时性需求</h3><p>为了做到实时性，就是服务端推送实时的数据变化给连接的web客户端，我选择 <a href="https://socket.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Socket.IO</a>，而不是client 去pulling，这样做的好处是：</p>
<ul>
<li>WebSocket的connection的延时（ms）远比pull 的interval（s) 小，能做到 <code>真·实时</code></li>
<li>实时性要求高的pulling带来的后端的开销大于WebSocket连接</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="后端"><a href="#后端" class="headerlink" title="后端"></a>后端</h2><p>还是因为我不是 一个JS guy，没有选择更native的node.js，再来，我最熟悉的是 python，于是也就没有尝鲜 golang（以后可以试试）。</p>
<p>好久之前我在翻pycon的视频时候，注意到Miguel老师写了 <a href="https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">python socket-io</a>  实现，还有和他亲自基于此的 <a href="https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flask-socketio</a> ，一直都想要研究来试试，所以我还是选择熟悉的Flask 😁。</p>
<h3 id="消息队列"><a href="#消息队列" class="headerlink" title="消息队列"></a>消息队列</h3><p>因为可扩展架构的需求（分布式数据库、可扩展后端）：</p>
<ul>
<li>后端的 server/service instance 在分布式的情况下需要支持对所有client连接的广播</li>
<li>考虑对数据库的写操作通过基于队列的异步call规避数据并行写入做到一致性</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="任务队列"><a href="#任务队列" class="headerlink" title="任务队列"></a>任务队列</h3><p>还有两个个我没有提及的需求是：</p>
<ul>
<li>外部 API 周期性调用<ul>
<li>我们的board之中，resource应该可以通过周期性的call CI系统的API 获取它被CI调用的状态信息。这需要异步执行的周期性任务</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>resource booking、scheduling<ul>
<li>后续提供终端用户去预约资源未来使用的功能，需要background task去监测、维护事件的触发和相关数据的读写</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>终于找到机会研究使用一下 <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celery</a> 了。</p>
<h2 id="生产环境部署"><a href="#生产环境部署" class="headerlink" title="生产环境部署"></a>生产环境部署</h2><p>因为兴趣原因，选择容器化，实践一下k8s的部署。</p>
<h2 id="测试"><a href="#测试" class="headerlink" title="测试"></a>测试</h2><p>Test Driven Develop，做到尽可能高coverage的单元测试。</p>
<h2 id="架构"><a href="#架构" class="headerlink" title="架构"></a>架构</h2><p>我简单地使用keynote.app 创建了一下架构图草稿如下。</p>
<img src="/project-resource-board-a-scalable-webapp-with-flask-socketio-and-vue-js/arch_diagram_0.png" class="">

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>通过 Nginx作为load balancer，以及外部用户的http webSocket 的tls加密解密节点，也就是说tls terminated in loadbalancer。</li>
<li>数据库的读写操作透过message queue(MQ)，这里它既是cache，又是写操作的queue，考虑使用Radis(<a href="http://python-rq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rq</a>)。</li>
<li>后端为计划任务单独做一个instance，board-scheduler：<ul>
<li>用来处理resource 预约到期事件</li>
<li>周期地通过call Celery抓取 外部CI 系统的状态</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Celary instance处理 async call（非 cpu tense的）<ul>
<li>抓取 外部系统CI状态</li>
<li>DB call</li>
<li>socketIO broadcast</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Notes-during-coding"><a href="#Notes-during-coding" class="headerlink" title="Notes during coding"></a>Notes during coding</h1><p>这里放一些我在实现过程中的一点点注意的点。</p>
<h2 id="It’s-not-reactive"><a href="#It’s-not-reactive" class="headerlink" title="It’s not reactive?!"></a>It’s not reactive?!</h2><p>因为没有看完所有Vue.js的文档，就开始搞，没有意识到Vue.js对对象和数组内部变化的track是有限制的，所以做mutation的时候不可以直接假设嘴边更改都被响应式的反应到view之中，需要用Vue.set或者splice😁。</p>
<p>我写到中间发现View怎么都无法按照我的预期得到更新，debug 去print值也明明更改了（<code>vuex mutation</code>按照预期执行了），有那么半个小时我的价值观崩坍了，各种Google都无果（大家不响应变化的原因都是实际上mutation没有执行），直到我重头看了Vue.js的文档才发现我犯了最蠢的错误….</p>

<p>虽然server端实现了简单地<code>RESTful API</code>，用来为之后增加<code>cli-client</code>方便，我依然决定不通过 <code>http request</code>，使用<code>flask-login</code> 管理服务端状态，它把login信息记录在<code>flask-socketio</code>的<code>session</code>之中了。</p>

<h1 id="Two-Sum"><a href="#Two-Sum" class="headerlink" title="Two Sum"></a>Two Sum</h1><p>我最初的实现是暴利遍历，看了答案学习到这个O(n)的实现。</p>
<p>关键在于这里对于number 元素 index的字典索引是一个<code>hash table</code>，它的查询是时间复杂度<code>O(1)</code>的。</p>

<h1 id="Add-two-numbers"><a href="#Add-two-numbers" class="headerlink" title="Add two numbers"></a>Add two numbers</h1><p>第二题是单链表逆序表示十进制正整数实现加法。</p>
<p>我的实现考虑了下面的情况:</p>
<ul>
<li>在相加一方位数大于另一方时候，在没有进位<code>tenFlag</code>的时候，加和的<code>ListNode</code>的<code>next</code>指针直接指向大位数的那些高位<code>node</code>，而非继续遍历大位数的所有位。</li>
</ul>
<p>另外，这是我第一次学习链表已经它的python实现，觉得很开心。</p>

<p>这是很傻的，因为它粗暴地假设先触及重复字母一定不包含于最终的最长子字符串。<br>反例:  <code>&quot;pwwkew&quot;</code> 作为输入之后，选择的最长子字符串是 <code>&quot;pw&quot;</code>， 而非 <code>&quot;wke&quot;</code> 。</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>整理了一下2017年8月份内部做的一个training的slide，去除了不能公布的部分，放在<a href="https://github.com/littlewey/workshops/blob/master/00-Openstack-Basic/release/Openstack_Basic_Blog.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这里</a>。</p>
<p>那次的training是针对telco. engineers开始学习NFVi的知识的为期一周的，每天半天session的集中入门。前两天是讲解这个slide，后三天是hands-on的手动安装基于Ubuntu VM集群上的Openstack O。</p>
<p>hands-on的部分我写成了单独的note，也放在<a href="https://note.siwei.info/deploy-openstack-o-on-self-privisoned-virtualbox-ubuntu-vms-manually/">这里</a>。</p>

<p>For simplicity, this guide describes configuring the Image service to use the <code>file</code> back end, which uploads and stores in a directory on the controller node hosting the Image service. By default, this directory is <code>/var/lib/glance/images/</code>.</p>
<p>Before you proceed, ensure that the controller node has at least several gigabytes of space available in this directory. Keep in mind that since the <code>file</code> back end is often local to a controller node, it is not typically suitable for a multi-node glance deployment.</p>
<p>For information on requirements for other back ends, see <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/image.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Configuration Reference</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Install-and-configure"><a href="#Install-and-configure" class="headerlink" title="Install and configure"></a>Install and configure</h3><p>This section describes how to install and configure the Image service, code-named glance, on the controller node.

<h3 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h3><p>Before you install and configure the Image service, you must create a database, service credentials, and API endpoints.</p>

<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a>Conclusion:</h3><p>the DHCP offer was sent out from DHCP agent dnsmasq, but the package cannot be captured from host bridge connecting to vm eth0. the issue is located in the provider network router, the ECN router 146.11.40.1 in our office.</p>
<p>By searching online, there is a tech called DHCP snooping to prevent multiple dhcp server in one LAN from router, which makes sense. </p>

<p>The OpenStack Block Storage service (cinder) adds persistent storage to a virtual machine. Block Storage provides an infrastructure for managing volumes, and interacts with OpenStack Compute to provide volumes for instances. The service also enables management of volume snapshots, and volume types.</p>
<p>The Block Storage service consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>cinder-api</p>
<p>Accepts API requests, and routes them to the <code>cinder-volume</code> for action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cinder-volume</p>
<p>Interacts directly with the Block Storage service, and processes such as the <code>cinder-scheduler</code>. It also interacts with these processes through a message queue. The <code>cinder-volume</code> service responds to read and write requests sent to the Block Storage service to maintain state. It can interact with a variety of storage providers through a driver architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cinder-scheduler daemon</p>
<p>Selects the optimal storage provider node on which to create the volume. A similar component to the <code>nova-scheduler</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cinder-backup daemon</p>
<p>The <code>cinder-backup</code> service provides backing up volumes of any type to a backup storage provider. Like the <code>cinder-volume</code> service, it can interact with a variety of storage providers through a driver architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Messaging queue</p>
<p>Routes information between the Block Storage processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The service provisions logical volumes on this device using the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/install-guide-ubuntu/common/glossary.html#term-logical-volume-manager-lvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LVM</a> driver and provides them to instances via <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/install-guide-ubuntu/common/glossary.html#term-iscsi-qualified-name-iqn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iSCSI</a> transport. You can follow these instructions with minor modifications to horizontally scale your environment with additional storage nodes.</p>
<h3 id="Prerequisites-4"><a href="#Prerequisites-4" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h3><p>Before you install and configure the Block Storage service on the storage node, you must prepare the storage device.</p>
<p>Perform these steps on the storage node.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install the supporting utility packages:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># apt install lvm2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p> Some distributions include LVM by default.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create the LVM physical volume <code>/dev/sdb</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># pvcreate /dev/sdb</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Physical volume <span class="string">"/dev/sdb"</span> successfully created</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>Create the LVM volume group <code>cinder-volumes</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># vgcreate cinder-volumes /dev/sdb</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Volume group <span class="string">"cinder-volumes"</span> successfully created</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The Block Storage service creates logical volumes in this volume group.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only instances can access Block Storage volumes. However, the underlying operating system manages the devices associated with the volumes. By default, the LVM volume scanning tool scans the <code>/dev</code> directory for block storage devices that contain volumes. If projects use LVM on their volumes, the scanning tool detects these volumes and attempts to cache them which can cause a variety of problems with both the underlying operating system and project volumes. You must reconfigure LVM to scan only the devices that contain the <code>cinder-volumes</code> volume group. Edit the <code>/etc/lvm/lvm.conf</code> file and complete the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <code>devices</code> section, add a filter that accepts the <code>/dev/sdb</code> device and rejects all other devices:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">devices &#123;</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">filter = [ <span class="string">"a/sdb/"</span>, <span class="string">"r/.*/"</span>]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Each item in the filter array begins with <code>a</code> for <strong>accept</strong> or <code>r</code> for <strong>reject</strong> and includes a regular expression for the device name. The array must end with <code>r/.*/</code> to reject any remaining devices. You can use the <strong>vgs -vvvv</strong> command to test filters.</p>
<p>If your storage nodes use LVM on the operating system disk, you must also add the associated device to the filter. For example, if the <code>/dev/sda</code> device contains the operating system:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">filter = [ <span class="string">"a/sda/"</span>, <span class="string">"a/sdb/"</span>, <span class="string">"r/.*/"</span>]</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">​```bash</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Similarly, <span class="keyword">if</span> your compute nodes use LVM on the operating system disk, you must also modify the filter <span class="keyword">in</span> the`/etc/lvm/lvm.conf` file on those nodes to include only the operating system disk.

    <title>upgrade hexo, theme</title>
    <url>/upgrade-hexo-theme/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>之前贪图省事儿，我把整个 hexo 的 folder 作为一个repository 放在了私有库里管理，在这个假设之下，我今天更新了hexo和主题。</p>
<h1 id="更新-hexo"><a href="#更新-hexo" class="headerlink" title="更新 hexo"></a>更新 hexo</h1><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install hexo -U</span><br><span class="line">npm install hexo-cli -U</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<h1 id="更新主题"><a href="#更新主题" class="headerlink" title="更新主题"></a>更新主题</h1><p>我之前删除了本地的主题文件中的 <code>.git</code> 文件，所以我的做法是：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>找出来之前的base, 得到delta的部分，<code>cherry-pick</code>到最新的branch。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>首先，找出来之前的base。</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git <span class="built_in">clone</span> &lt;repo-of-the-theme&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">cd</span> &lt;repo-of-the-theme&gt;</span><br><span class="line">git <span class="built_in">log</span> <span class="comment"># and to find the date last time I modified theme files and got the &lt;git-hash-for-mod-base&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">git checkout &lt;git-hash-for-mod-base&gt;</span><br><span class="line">git checkout -b mod_branch</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>把现在的theme文件通过copy来apply上去。</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cp -r &lt;path_of_previous_theme&gt;/* &lt;repo-of-the-theme&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">cd</span> &lt;repo-of-the-theme&gt;</span><br><span class="line">git add .</span><br><span class="line">git commit -m <span class="string">"my_mod"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><code>cherry-pick</code>到最新的branch。</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git checkout master</span><br><span class="line">git cherry-pick mod_branch</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>这时候如果遇到需要手动解决的conflict，手动解决一下，解决完之后，做<code>cherry-pick</code>。</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git add .</span><br><span class="line">git cherry-pick --<span class="built_in">continue</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>至此，主题的local repo就已经是 <code>latest + mod_by_me</code> 的了。</p>
<h3 id="管理自己的主题-repo"><a href="#管理自己的主题-repo" class="headerlink" title="管理自己的主题 repo"></a>管理自己的主题 repo</h3><p>在主题文件中创建自己的branch</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git checkout -b my_branch</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>设定 upstream branch 为远端的分支，比如这里是master</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git branch --<span class="built_in">set</span>-upstream-to=origin/master my_branch</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<blockquote>
<p>更新</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git pull --rebase</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>设定 push 远端为自己的 (private) repo，然后 push到自己的远端 repo</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">❯ git remote -v</span><br><span class="line">origin	https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next (fetch)</span><br><span class="line">origin	https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next (push)</span><br><span class="line">~/note/themes/next ⇡</span><br><span class="line">❯ git remote <span class="built_in">set</span>-url --push origin git@github.com:littlewey/hexo-theme-next</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">~/note/themes/next ⇡</span><br><span class="line">❯ git remote -v</span><br><span class="line">origin	https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next (fetch)</span><br><span class="line">origin	git@github.com:littlewey/hexo-theme-next (push)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">❯ git push origin HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As we printed in first step only, we can see now the learning rate is way faster in initial step thus the first L printed is in smaller range!</p>
<p>And we also know it’s descenting slower after 10 ephoch, thus it’s not reaching our target <code>575000</code> in small steps.</p>
<p>I (for sure) know that I need to use adaptive learning rate and customised learning rate per feature(adagrade/ adam), while before that, I would like to see how it goes with smaller learning rate, while it goes to mess!</p>

<p>It’s basically the same, the difference is only:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the very begining, ADAGRAD went to crazy field, while it self corrected to normal path soon</li>
<li>ADAGRAD will be converging slower than BGD …</li>
<li>our BGD was actually human tunned one, which means ADAGRAD is easier to find themself the correct path (no need for human invention)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also we could see the initial 30 epoch:</p>

    <title>start Using hexo</title>
    <url>/start-Using-hexo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>今天终于弄一个记录 note 的 blog，选择了<code>github pages</code> 存放静态文件，<code>hexo</code> 作为网站生成器的方案。</p>
<p>选择静态生成而不是有后端的 app 的原因是我这几年习惯用 <code>markdown</code> 记录一些技术的笔记，想着尽可能方便的搬运一些到这个 blog 上。虽然我之前其实给 team 内部搭建一些基于 markdown的文档网站化的时候用的是<code>hugo</code>，这次还是选择了生态稍微好一点的<code>hexo</code>。</p>
<p>站名就叫 <code>思为笔记</code>/<code>Siwei note</code>: <a href="https://note.siwei.info">note.siwei.info</a>。</p>
<p>我原有的笔记有如下特点:</p>
<ul>
<li>都是在不同 folder 下边的单个<code>markdown</code>文件加上同级的一个 folder, 内部存放因用到的图片附件。</li>
<li>有一些 LeTaX 的公式</li>
<li>有 <code>[TOC]</code></li>
<li>etc… tbf</li>
</ul>
<p>我会把迁移的经验更新在这个post 里。</p>
